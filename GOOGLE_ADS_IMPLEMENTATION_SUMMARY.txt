          GOOGLE ADS OPTIMIZATION - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

Date: 2024
Project: Alberton Battery Mart (abm2)
Purpose: Address critical structural gaps identified by Google Ads team for 
         improved Quality Score and conversion rates

================================================================================
                          ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

The Google Ads team identified 3 critical structural gaps between the keyword 
strategy and landing page routing:

1. BATTERY SIZE GAP (Critical)
   - Issue: Keyword list targets specific battery codes (646, 652, 619, 628)
   - Problem: No direct landing page for size-based searches
   - Risk: Users searching "652 battery price" forced to filter again = lower conversion

2. VEHICLE MAKE GAP
   - Issue: Targeting "Toyota battery" and "Ford battery" keywords
   - Problem: Only had /vehicles/[make]/[model] (too specific)
   - Risk: Users searching "Toyota battery" without model get wrong page

3. EMERGENCY LANDING PAGE GAP
   - Issue: Mobile battery replacement is an "emergency" service
   - Problem: Home page has too many distractions for urgent searches
   - Risk: Lower conversion for "dead battery help" type keywords

================================================================================
                          SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED
